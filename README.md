## 2. Motivation

### Problem Statement

Save Fur Pets (SFP) is a volunteer-run animal rescue organization that faced critical operational inefficiencies:

- **Fragmented Workflow:** Adoption processes relied on scattered tools—spreadsheets, email threads, and Google Forms—making it difficult to track animals and applications.
- **Slow Turnaround:** Animals could take days to move from foster care to public listings due to manual coordination.
- **Inconsistent Processes:** Different coordinators followed different workflows, leading to errors and miscommunication.
- **Privacy Risks:** Sensitive adopter information (names, phone numbers, addresses) was stored and shared in one platform only with risks of lossing or leaking.
- **Lack of transparency:** No standardized procedure in performing various volunteer jobs, information acquiring process not centeralized.

### Significance

By building a centralized, cloud-native platform, we aimed to:

1. **Reduce volunteer workload** through automation (e.g., automated emails, calendar invites)
2. **Increase adoption speed** by streamlining the publish-and-interview workflow
3. **Enhance data security** with role-based access control and encrypted storage
4. **Improve transparency** with real-time status tracking for all stakeholders
5. **Demonstrate cloud best practices** including containerization, orchestration, and monitoring

This project directly addresses the operational pain points of a real-world organization while serving as a comprehensive demonstration of cloud computing principles.

## 3. Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Centralize Adoption Workflow:**  
   Consolidate foster submissions, coordinator reviews, applicant applications, interview scheduling, and contract signing into a single integrated system.

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
   Support four distinct user roles—Foster, Interviewer, Interviewer, and Applicant(currently applicants are treated as individual application) with appropriate permissions and UI views.

3. **Ensure Data Privacy and Security:**  
   Use JWT authentication, encrypted storage with hashing, and presigned URLs for media access.

4. **Deploy on Cloud Infrastructure:**  
   Containerize the application using Docker and orchestrate it with Kubernetes on DigitalOcean, demonstrating production-ready deployment patterns.

5. **Demonstrate High-Availability Patterns:**  
   Implement rolling updates, auto-scaling via HPA, health checks, and persistent storage to ensure system reliability.

6. **Support Advance Features:**
   Implemented email automation with SendGrid to improve workflow efficiency and reduce volunteer workloads.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Animal Management (Foster):** Fosters can create, upload photos, and publish animal profiles to the public site.  
✅ **Animal Management (Admin):** Admins have full control - create, review, publish, and delete animals from the system.  
✅ **Application Management:** Applicants submit forms, coordinators triage and assign interviewers.  
✅ **Interview Scheduling:** Interviewers propose time slots; system sends automatic email notifications with interview details.  
✅ **Contract Management:** Automated contract generation, e-signature integration, and adoption confirmation (admin-approved only).  
✅ **Kubernetes Deployment:** Full orchestration on DOKS with rolling updates, auto-scaling, and persistent storage.

## 10. Lessons Learned & Concluding Remarks

### 10.1 Technical Lessons

**1. Kubernetes requires deliberate configuration.**  
Rolling updates, readiness/liveness probes, and HPA tuning are essential for zero-downtime deployment. Misconfiguration can easily cause outages.

**2. Environment variable management is critical for portability.**  
Separating build-time variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) from runtime configuration (e.g., `FRONTEND_URL`) prevented deployment failures and ensured consistent environments across local, staging, and production.

**3. Docker volume mounts must be scoped carefully.**  
An overly broad bind mount initially overwrote `node_modules`, causing missing-module errors. Restricting mounts and understanding Docker layer behavior resolved the issue.

**4. Presigned URLs greatly simplify secure media handling.**  
Direct browser→Spaces uploads reduced API load, bandwidth usage, and architectural complexity.

**5. State machines improve workflow reliability.**  
Modeling the animal lifecycle (Draft → Published → Adopted) enforced valid transitions and clarified business logic.

### 10.2 Project Management Lessons

**1. Clear role ownership reduces integration problems.**  
Assigning DevOps, Backend, and Frontend responsibilities enabled efficient parallel development and minimized merge conflicts.

**2. Early documentation prevents rework.**  
Maintaining API specs, environment variable tables, and deployment guides improved onboarding and reduced debugging time.

**3. Iterative development is superior to big-bang delivery.**  
Delivering features in sequence (animals → applications → interviews → contracts) allowed early feedback and smoother integration.

### 10.3 Real-World Insights

**1. Nonprofits often struggle with fragmented workflows.**  
Building for a real rescue organization revealed how much manual effort can be reduced through centralized digital systems.

**2. Security and privacy must be intentional from the start.**  
Working with PII required strict RBAC, audit logging, and careful API exposure; security cannot be bolted on later.

**3. Cloud-native architecture requires a mindset shift.**  
Designing with containers, orchestration, and declarative infrastructure improved reliability, deployment consistency, and scalability.

### 10.5 Concluding Remarks

The **SFP Animal Management System** demonstrates practical cloud-native engineering: containerization, orchestration, persistent state management, secure workflows, and automated communication. Beyond meeting course requirements, it meaningfully improves the operational workflow of a real nonprofit organization. This project provided hands-on experience with designing scalable cloud systems and showed how thoughtful engineering can streamline real-world adoption processes.

### Final Thoughts

This project transcends a typical course assignment. It delivers a production-ready system for a real organization while demonstrating mastery of cloud computing, infrastructure, and full-stack development. We hope this system continues to benefit SFP and inspires other student teams to build technology for causes they believe in.
